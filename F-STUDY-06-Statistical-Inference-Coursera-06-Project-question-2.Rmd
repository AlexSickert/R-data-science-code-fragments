Now in the second portion of the class, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. 

    Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 
    Provide a basic summary of the data.
    Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
    State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions. 

Some criteria that you will be evaluated on

    Did you  perform an exploratory data analysis of at least a single plot or table highlighting basic features of the data?
    Did the student perform some relevant confidence intervals and/or tests?
    Were the results of the tests and/or intervals interpreted in the context of the problem correctly? 
    Did the student describe the assumptions needed for their conclusions?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
